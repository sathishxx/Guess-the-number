# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple browser-based "Guess the Number" game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game gives feedback on whether the player's guess is correct or not, and updates the score accordingly.

## Features:
- **Random number generation**: A random number is generated between 1 and 10.
- **User input**: Players can input their guess in an input field.
- **Score tracking**: The score starts at 10 and decreases with each incorrect guess.
- **Visual effects**: Retro pixelated background with animated effects.

## How to Play:
1. Enter a number between 1 and 10 in the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button to submit your guess.
3. If your guess is correct, you will win the game, and the score will remain the same.
4. If your guess is incorrect, the score decreases by 1.
5. If no number is entered, the score is reset to 0, and the game ends.
